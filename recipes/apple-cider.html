        <p>This apple cider recipe is super easy to make. I used to buy the spices already mixed at the grocery store, and they stopped carrying them, 
            so I just made my own. Great for a shower or get-together, and the slow cooker keeps it warm so guests can enjoy it through the night! 
            Serve with a slice of orange, and add spiced rum, if desired.</p>
